    void method1() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}
----

== Step 1

Here is how you can include entire file from sample code:

[source,sql]

----

[WARNING]
A warning message here.

== Step 2

Here is how you can include specific lines of code segments from sample code:

[source,java]
----
